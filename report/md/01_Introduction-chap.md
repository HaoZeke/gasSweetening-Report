## Problem Definition

The main purpose of the gas treatment step is to remove the \ch{H2S} from the
sour gas. Using the principles of mass transfer and organic chemistry, the
project involves suggestion of a suitable solvent, design of absorption and
stripping column, process description and a relevant material and energy balance
of the overall plant giving details of the major equipment used in the plant as
well as cost estimation and economic feasibility of the project. The plant
structure is shown in @fig:plantStruct.
