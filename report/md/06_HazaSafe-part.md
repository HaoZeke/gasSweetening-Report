# Material Safety and Toxicology

Before considering the safety of a plant we would do well to discuss briefly the
nature of toxicity in general. A colloquial definition, which captures much of
the nuances of the difficulties associated with attempts is succinctly
paraphrased as:


> Every substance is deadly, it's only the amount required which varies.

Naturally there are more quantitative definitions, especially for the chemical
process industries. Commonly cited ones are [@crowlChemicalProcessSafety2002]:

Toxicology
:   The toxicity of a chemical or physical agent is a property of the agent describing its effect 
on biological organisms. This is a substance property.

Toxic Hazard
:   This is the likelihood of damage to biological organisms based 
on exposure resulting from transport and other physical factors of
usage. This may be reduced by usage of industrial hygiene practices.

## Global Standards

The gold standard of chemicals and affiliated safety issues is undoubtedly the
phenomenal guidance document [@vereintenationenGloballyHarmonizedSystem2017]  published by the United Nations and updated every
two years. This document, popularly known as the UN GHS Purple Book is the epitome of
global expertise and research and is currently in it's seventh iteration.

### Overview

Very broadly, has the following salient features:

* Defines physical, health and environmental hazards of chemicals and harmonizes classification criteria;
* Standardizes the content and format of chemical labels and Safety Data Sheets.

The entire GHS range of hazards may be gleaned by inspection of @fig:ghsHazard.

### Safety Data Sheets
A Safety Data Sheet (SDS), also called a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) in
the pre-GHS era, is a very important document which is meant to list major 
hazards of an industrial substance or mixture and to provide advice on safety
precautions.

An SDS should be prepared and provided for a substance or mixture meeting
classification criteria for a hazard class or for a mixture containing an
ingredient meeting criteria for carcinogenic, toxic to reproduction or specific
target organ toxicity exceeding certain defined cut-off value limits.

The latest harmonized scheme for the chemical properties under consideration are
divided into $16$ sections:

* Section $1$ Identification of the substance or mixture and of the supplier;
* Section $2$ Hazard identification;
* Section $3$ Composition/information on ingredients;
* Section $4$ First-aid measures;
* Section $5$ Fire-fighting measures;
* Section $6$ Accidental release measures;
* Section $7$ Handling and storage;
* Section $8$ Exposure controls/personal protection;
* Section $9$ Physical and chemical properties;
* Section $10$ Stability and reactivity;
* Section $11$ Toxicological information;
* Section $12$ Ecological information;
* Section $13$ Disposal consideration;
* Section $14$ Transport information;
* Section $15$ Regulatory information;
* Section $16$ Other information.

### Caveats and legality

Like all UN guidelines and documents the ones listed in the Purple book are also
not legally binding in any sense of the term, except in terms of a compliance in
moral terms of a government towards its citizens.

As such there are many countries which adopt the guidelines and format
specifications as stipulated by the Globally Harmonized System of Classification
and Labelling of Chemicals but there are as many which adopt only a subset of a
superset of the same as per the needs of the country in question. This modular
adoption policy is often called the GHS Building Blocks approach.

## Indian Perspective

In India, the government has in the past been very proactive in terms of both
industrial growth and also the safety and conservation measures, having
established by Act of Parliament, both the Bureau of Energy Efficiency and
adopting a form of the UN specifications that same year. As the last amendment
to the Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rule, $1989$ was in
$2000$, India therefore lists $9$  mandatory sections for the MSDS as described in
the Schedule to the aforementioned act on hazardous chemicals.

### Material Safety Data Sheets

* Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) are documents prepared by the 
manufactures/ suppliers of the chemicals and contain information on physical 
and chemical properties of the material, potential hazards of the material and 
how to work safely with these materials. They also contain information on 
usages, storage, handling and emergency procedures related to the hazards of 
the materials. In fact, they provide a single reference for all information about 
hazardous substances.
* MSDSs provide information on chemicals, chemical compounds and chemical 
mixtures and are primarily intended for use by the personnel working with 
hazardous chemical substances.
* MSDSs need to be updated every three years, but if any significant new 
information becomes available about the material, then it should be 
incorporated into MSDS even before lapse of three years. 
  
### Indian MSDS Sections

As mandated by the Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rule,
$1989$ (amended in $2000$) the following sections must be present for a document
to be considered to be a material safety data sheet.

* Section 1: Chemical Identity 
* Section 2: Physical and Chemical Data 
* Section 3: Fire and Explosion Hazard Data 
* Section 4: Reactivity Data 
* Section 5: Health Hazard Data 
* Section 6: Preventive Measures 
* Section 7: Emergency and First Aid Measure 
* Section 8: Additional Information/ References 
* Section 9: Manufacturer/ Supplier Data 

Based on a typical MSDS and data made available via @MaterialSafetyData we infer
the following about these sections.

Section I: Chemical Product and Company Identification
:   This section contains product identification, name and address of the
    supplier of the MSDS and emergency telephone numbers.
    
Section II: Composition and Information on Ingredients
:   This section contains percentage composition by weight of the ingredients
    and toxicological data on the ingredients of the given chemical.

Section III: Hazard Identification
:   This section contains the information on toxicology of the chemical and its
    acute and chronic health effects.
    
Section IV: First Aid Measures
:   This section provides for exposure routes, signs and symptoms of exposure,
    and emergency and first aid procedures.
    
Section V: Fire and Explosion Data
:   This section contains information about the flammability, stability and the
    reactivity of the substance.
    
Section VI: Accidental Release Measures
:   This section provides for measures to be adopted during accidental release
    of the chemical due to spills, leaks, etc.
    
Section VII: Handling and Storage
:   This section contains precautions for safe handling, storage conditions and
    reactivity with other materials.
    
Section VIII: Exposure Controls or Personal Protection
:   This section provides details about the types of Personal Protective
    Equipment (PPE) required by the person working with these chemicals, hygiene
    practices and ventilation requirements to reduce potential for exposure.
    
Section IX: Physical and Chemical Properties
: This section contains the physical and chemical properties of the chemical.

## MDEA Toxicity
Much of the physical and chemical properties have been elaborated in the solvent
selection of the previous sections however we will here note the unique nature
of MDEA in the Indian legal and industrial system.

* MDEA is not among the $~800$ hazardous chemicals listed in the Schedule to the
Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rule of $1989$ (amended
in $2000$).
* Inspite of this MDEA may not be sold or manufactured without the dissemination
  of a material safety data sheet.

This apparent paradox is resolved by a careful examination of the Schedules to
  the relevant Act of Parliament, where is mentioned in Schedule - IV that the
  substances involved in the desulphurization, manufacture and transformation of
  sulphur containing compounds as well as compounds part of installations for
  distillation, refining or other processing of petroleum or petroleum products
  are to be regulated by the rules mentioned in the aforementioned Act.
  
  We therefore note that in the quantities used by the industry, MDEA is indeed
  a chemical with hazardous potential and thus it's MSDS has been listed in the
  Appendix. We also note the hazardous quantities of the sulphur in @fig:deadlySulfer which is
  removed by the action of gas sweetening, which warrants such special
  treatment of the mild MDEA.

# HAZOP Theory

## Introduction

Hazard and operability studies (HAZOP) is defined by
@perry1997perry to be:

HAZOP
:   A set of formal hazard identification and elimination procedures designed to
    identify hazards to people, process plants, and the environment.

Along with failure mode and effect analysis (FEMA), and
other plant safety studies showcase the combined efforts of many industry and
academic collaborations. The process hazards analysis recommends appropriate
measures to reduce the risk, including (but not limited to) the safety
interlocks to be implemented in the safety interlock system.

![Risk Management](img/sideRisk.png){#fig:sideRisk}

We formalize here the definition and therefore the relevant differences between
a **hazard** and a **risk** as sometimes in common parlance they are used
interchangeably.

Hazards
:   The inherent potential of a material or activity to harm people, property,
    or the environment. Hazards do not have a probability component.
    
Risks
:   These are a measure of economic loss or injury in terms of both the incident
    likelihood and magnitude of loss of injury. Risks imply the probability of
    an incident occurring. As shown in @fig:sideRisk
    

## Fault Trees

Due to the complexities in the form of many variables in the analysis of a
typical plant or even a sub portion of the plant, there exist computational
fault tree generators which are used to somewhat automate the HAZOP studies.

These computer generated studies should only be used as a guideline as they are
based on simple boolean logic and probability which is no substitute for an
experienced process engineer and HAZOP analyst.

### Boolean Operator Symbols

The logical symbols are enlisted in @fig:faultTreeOne, @fig:faultTreeTwo,
@fig:faultTreeBoolean as mentioned in @lees2012lees.
