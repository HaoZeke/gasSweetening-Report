# Process Flow-sheeting

We shall discuss the control of the process shown in @fig:flowSheet and @fig:aminePlant1.

## Standard Equipment

Each amine gas sweetening plant has at the very least, the following:

* amine contactor tower
* reboiler or surge tank
* reflux condenser or solution cooler in a common aerial cooler package
* reflux accumulator
* reflux pump or pumps
* main solvent pump or pumps
* solvent booster pump or pumps
* full-flow filter for rich solvent
* charcoal filter
* control panel or motor starters

The solvents which may be handled by the generalized flowsheets and equipment
noted previously are:

* Monoethanolamine (MEA)
* Diethanolamine (DEA)
* Methyldiethanolamine (MDEA)
* Diglycolamine (DGA)
* Sulfinol solvent

## Standard Process
The steps followed in ammonia sweetening systems across the world have been
largely standardized as a testament to the maturity and utility of this process.

These standard process steps are:

1. Sour gas enters the contactor tower and rises through the descending amine solution.
2. Purified gas flows from the top of the tower.
3. The amine solution, carrying absorbed acid gases, leaves the tower for the
heat exchanger or optional flash tank.
4. Rich amine is heated by hot regenerated lean amine in the heat exchanger.
5. Rich amine is further heated in the regeneration still column, by heat supplied from the reboiler. 
The steam rising through the still liberates water and CO2, regenerating the amine.
6. Steam and acid gases separated from the rich amine are condensed and cooled,
respectively, in the reflux condenser.
7. Condensed steam is separated in the reflux accumulator and returned to the still. Acid gases may 
be vented, incinerated, or directed to a sulfur recovery system.
8. Hot regenerated lean amine is cooled in a solvent aerial cooler and circulated to the contactor 
tower, completing the cycle.
9. A variety of heat sources can be used for the still reboilerâ€”direct fired, waste heat, hot oil, and
