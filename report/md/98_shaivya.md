# Tray Column Design

## Objective
To find out the height of the column and the thickness of torispherical head as
well as the thickness of the trays.

From the previous calculations we note summarized the results in @tbl:dataTowerReplace

|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Shell Internal Diameter   | $2464 \si{\mm}$          |
| Valve Trays               | $14$                     |
| Tray Spacing              | $600 \si{\mm}$           |
| Hole Diameter             | $12 \si{\mm}$            |
| Plate Thickness           | $18 \si{\mm}$            |
