This is a complete reproducible project I carried out towards the completion of
my bachelors degree in chemical engineering at HBTU, Kanpur.

## Technology

* The report is generated with a tup based  [goYoda](https://github.com/HaoZeke/goYoda) prototype
* There might be a gatsby site eventually
* COMSOL was used for the mass and energy balances
* [DWSIM](http://dwsim.inforside.com.br/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) was used for generating the flowsheets and for dealing with the steady state usage
* R was used for the statistical portions
